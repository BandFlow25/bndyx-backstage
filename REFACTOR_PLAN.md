- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Audit all context providers and consumers
  - [ ] Refactor contexts to use the Context Selector pattern
  - [ ] Evaluate state management alternatives for complex state

  - [ ] Implement memoization for context values
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring for context-related re-renders

### 2.3 Shared Component Migration
- **Priority**: High (upgraded from Medium)
- **Description**: Use shared components from bndy-ui and extend as needed.
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Identify existing components in bndy-ui that can be used (Button, Calendar, etc.)
  - [x] Create guidelines for using shared components (Created SHARED_COMPONENTS.md)
  - [x] Enhance existing shared components in bndy-ui (Button, Card, Badge)
  - [x] Update calendar components to use shared components (CalendarContainer, CalendarHeader, CalendarLegend)
  - [x] Audit for duplicate components (Created DUPLICATE_COMPONENTS.md)
  - [ ] Remove duplicate UI components from bndy-core (Badge, Button, Card)
  - [ ] Identify new components that should be added to bndy-ui
  - [ ] Contribute new shared components to bndy-ui
  - [ ] Update remaining components in bndy-core to use bndy-ui components
  - [ ] Add tests for shared components

## Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements (2-3 weeks)

### 3.1 Import Pattern Standardization
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Standardize import patterns throughout the codebase.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Define import pattern standards
  - [ ] Update imports to use consistent patterns
  - [ ] Configure ESLint rules to enforce import patterns
  - [ ] Refactor circular dependencies
  - [ ] Optimize bundle size with code splitting

### 3.2 Code Cleanup

- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Remove commented-out code
  - [ ] Replace debug logging with a proper logging system
  - [ ] Fix all TypeScript warnings and errors
  - [ ] Implement consistent error handling
  - [ ] Add missing documentation
  - [ ] Run linters and fix issues
