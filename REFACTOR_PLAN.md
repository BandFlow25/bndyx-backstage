## Phase 2: Component Architecture (3-4 weeks)

### 2.1 Component Refactoring
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Break down large components and standardize component structure.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Identify components exceeding 200-300 lines
  - [ ] Refactor large components into smaller, focused components
  - [ ] Standardize component APIs and prop interfaces
  - [ ] Create a component library with documentation
  - [ ] Implement consistent error boundaries

### 2.2 Context Optimization
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Improve context usage to minimize unnecessary re-renders and simplify component hierarchy.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Audit all context providers and consumers
  - [ ] Refactor contexts to use the Context Selector pattern
  - [ ] Evaluate state management alternatives for complex state
  - [ ] Simplify authentication flow in MainLayout.tsx
  - [ ] Implement memoization for context values
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring for context-related re-renders

### 2.3 Shared Component Migration
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Move shared components to bndy-ui for better reusability.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Identify components that should be shared
  - [ ] Refactor and move shared components to bndy-ui
  - [ ] Update imports in bndy-core
  - [ ] Create clear guidelines for component ownership
  - [ ] Add tests for shared components
  - [ ] Document component APIs

## Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements (2-3 weeks)

### 3.1 Import Pattern Standardization
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Standardize import patterns throughout the codebase.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Define import pattern standards
  - [ ] Update imports to use consistent patterns
  - [ ] Configure ESLint rules to enforce import patterns
  - [ ] Refactor circular dependencies
  - [ ] Optimize bundle size with code splitting

### 3.2 Code Cleanup
- **Priority**: Low
- **Description**: Remove technical debt and improve code quality.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Remove commented-out code
  - [ ] Replace debug logging with a proper logging system
  - [ ] Fix all TypeScript warnings and errors
  - [ ] Implement consistent error handling
  - [ ] Add missing documentation
  - [ ] Run linters and fix issues

### 3.3 Testing Improvements
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Enhance test coverage and testing practices.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Add unit tests for critical components
  - [ ] Implement integration tests for key user flows
  - [ ] Add theme testing utilities
  - [ ] Set up continuous integration for tests
  - [ ] Create testing documentation and guidelines

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization (2 weeks)

### 4.1 Rendering Optimization
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Improve rendering performance and reduce unnecessary re-renders.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Audit component re-renders
  - [ ] Implement React.memo for pure components
  - [ ] Optimize useEffect dependencies
  - [ ] Implement lazy loading for routes
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring

### 4.2 Data Fetching Optimization
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Improve data fetching strategies for better performance.
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Implement data caching
  - [ ] Add pagination for large data sets
  - [ ] Optimize Firebase queries
  - [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates
  - [ ] Add loading states and skeletons

## Implementation Guidelines

### Coding Standards
- Follow the existing style guide for all new and modified code
- Use Tailwind for styling with CSS variables for theme colors
- Implement proper error handling for all operations
- Add comprehensive documentation for all new components and functions
- Write tests for all new functionality

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all utility functions
- Component tests for UI components
- Integration tests for key user flows
- Theme switching tests for all components
- Performance tests for critical paths

### Refactoring Approach
- Incremental changes with regular testing
- Focus on one component or feature at a time
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Regular code reviews
- Continuous integration to catch regressions
